This is the first release from J.dewitz
This release does not use Jdan-S's content, but instead reconstructs and expands on some of that. 

Each varaition comes without the color screen as gambatte can handle pallettes better than overlays do with a few exceptions and GB Light looks cool.

 

I wasn't a huge Game Gear player and I remember the screen kind of sucking, so I included a beat up overlay for the sake of nostalgia. It's terrible, but it's better than you think.

This overlay tries to reimagine the Game Gear and Neo Geo Pocket/Color as a portrait device, but the idea is pretty simple.

For best results, turn off filters and shaders, turn on integer scaling. Any _grid overlay has a faux lcd screen effect. It's just a grid. Looks alright.

If you want full screen, turn off integer scaling and scale the overlay to 1.10 for GB. Not sure what that number will be for other systems. 

As usual please don't sell this pack. I do this to support the community. 

Enjoy
